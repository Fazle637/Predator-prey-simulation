# Predator–Prey Population Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates the interaction between predator and prey populations
using the Lotka–Volterra model and numerical methods.

## Mathematical Model
The system is described by two differential equations:

dX/dt = aX − bXY  
dY/dt = −cY + dXY  

Where:
- X = prey population
- Y = predator population

## Numerical Method
The Euler Method is used to approximate the solution of the differential equations.

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Output
The program produces:
- Population vs Time graphs
- Optional animation of predator and prey

## Conclusion
The simulation shows oscillatory behavior of predator and prey populations,
demonstrating real-world ecological dynamics.
